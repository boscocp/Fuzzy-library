# Fuzzy-library
This is a personal training of Artificial Intelligence for games. This C# library was made to be used by me in classroom to teach Artificial Intelligence. Students can use it in unity for game development. The FLC.txt contains an example of a Fuzzy Control Language. For now, there is possible only create triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy variables. And the unique type of defuzzification is center of mass.

Still under development, but already functional.
